                        This was my first game developing experience. I had to do my first game in a two and a half month sprint. I used Unity Engine
                        as the game engine. <br />
                        I made the characters, and snowballs myself and the other assets were downloaded from the Unity asset store. <br />

                        This game was our first group school project. We made a game set on a floating cargo ship in the midel off the ocean. <br />
                        Player is a coast guard who boards a ship only to find that the ship is deserted. Then his own boat just disappeared 
                        and he must find a way to get out of the ghoast ship. <br />
                        In this game, we had five coders and four graphic artists in our group. Everyone had their own areas of responsibility 
                        and I had AI movement and behavior. I also made audio settings for this game. <br />

                        This game was our last school project and we chalenged ourselves and started developing the first multiplayer game.
                        This game is "Ah, Rats". We had a team of eight people, four coders, three artist and one animator. <br />
                        The Game is a multiplayer game where one of the players is a human and the others are rats. Rats try to do tasks and get the human player
                        rage meter full. Human tries to kill the rats by throwing objects and hitting the rats. <br />
                        In this game, I made a rat's flight mode which is a special power and an interactive indicator for players to see where objects break and tasks are done. <br />
                        In this project, problem solving skills were emphasized and we encouraged each other a lot. We finished the game demo in about three months.
