                        This was my first game developing experience. I had to do my first game in a two and a half month sprint. I used Unity Engine
                        as the game engine. <br />
                        I made the characters, and snowballs myself and the other assets were downloaded from the Unity asset store.

                        This game was our first group school project. We made a game set on a floating cargo ship in the midel off the ocean. <br />
                        Player is a coast guard who boards a ship only to find that the ship is deserted. Then his own boat just disappeared 
                        and he must find a way to get out of the ghoast ship. <br />
                        In this game, we had five coders and four graphic artists in our group. Everyone had their own areas of responsibility 
                        and I had AI movement and behavior. I also made audio settings for this game.
